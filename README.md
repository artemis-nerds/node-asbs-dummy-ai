# node-asbs-dummy-ai


A dummy ship AI for the Artemis Space Bridge Simulator, using [node-asbs-lib](https://github.com/artemis-nerds/node-asbs-lib).

This demonstrates how to mimic console commands using `node-asbs-lib`. The AI itself is stateless and as stupid as it can get: it just moves around, turning at the edges of the map and sending some comms chatter.

Besides showing off the capabilities of `node-asbs-lib`, this allows developers to easily spawn several player ships into a game server, so it can be used as a debugging aid for game servers and proxies.
